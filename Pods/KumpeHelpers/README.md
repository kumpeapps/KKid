KumpeHelpers is a collection of helper files commonly used in most of my apps. I created this framework as an easy way of importing my most frequently used scripts instead of having to re-write them or copy/paste in each app and easily syncing changes between all of my apps. So.....this framework is designed for my use but feel free to use it if you wish.

## Frameworks Used
- Foundation
- CoreData
- UIKit
- CoreText

## Third Party Frameworks Used

- [ReachabilitySwift](https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift)
